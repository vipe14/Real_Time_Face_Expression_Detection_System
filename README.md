# Real_Time_Face_Expression_Detection_System
Welcome to the Real-Time Facial Expression Detection System project repository. This project focuses on creating a real-time system that can analyze video streams from your webcam and accurately identify facial expressions.

# Project Overview
Facial expression recognition in real-time has a wide range of applications, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis in videos, and emotion-aware user interfaces. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to achieve real-time facial expression detection directly from your webcam.

# Key Features
**Real-Time Detection:** The system is designed to work in real-time, providing instant feedback on facial expressions.

**Multi-Class Classification:** The model can classify facial expressions into multiple classes, typically including emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

**Webcam Integration:** The project directly accesses your webcam feed, making it easy to use and suitable for live applications.
